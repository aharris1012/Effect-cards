                            <p>Hawaii’s Big Island, which is the common term used for the state of Hawaii, is growing by more than 42 acres each year because of the Kilauea Volcano.
                                 his volcano has been erupting for around 30 years now, which is impressive in and of itself.
                                 Mauna Loa, is one of the biggest volcanoes in the entire world.
                                 It is also located on the Big Island and its lava fields were once a training site for astronauts before they went to the moon.</p>

                    <h1>Iceland</h1>
                    <p>The majority of present-day Icelanders (more than 50%) believe in the existence of fantastical beings such as elves and trolls. 
                        There are many amusing stories and legends about these creatures, and Icelanders go so far as to postpone construction projects if it's believed that something is going to be built where elves currently live.</p>
